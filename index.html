				Welcome to Disney for the Souza/Webb wedding!  Nicholas and Ashley are very excited to share this experience with their friends and family.  There is plenty to do in Walt Disney World besides the 4 theme parks and 2 water parks.  Below is Ashley’s Tips for enduring those parks (and of course where to eat!) along with other non-park options.  We hope you have fun celebrating this special occasion with us!
			</p>
			<h3>Animal Kingdom:</h3>
			<hr>
			<p>
				<strong>Fair warning</strong>: this park can get very hot during the heat of the day because a lot of it is concrete and in the open!
				<br><br>
				This is a park that has a nice balance of rides and animal Treks: of course the Maharajah Jungle Trek is by far Ashley’s favorite (all the Tigers!).  You can also take the train over to Rafiki’s Planet Watch to learn more about conservation, see the veterinary quarters, and possibly get to see a procedure!  Fast Passes are nice but not necessary for certain rides, such as Na’vi River Journey.
				<br><br>
				FastPass best options: Avatar Flight of Passage, Expedition Everest,  Dinosaur, Kahli River Rapids (*YOU WILL GET WET!), Tree of Life-It’s Tough to be a Bug! (this is a cute 3D show with Flick- from A Bug’s Life), Kilamanjaro Safari
				<br><br>
				Ashley’s Tip: I found that waiting in line can also be fun especially after a long day and you no longer have anything pressing to do: Avatar Flight of Passage has a LONG que line HOWEVER; you go through different rooms which makes it really fun and immersive; the art is also very beautiful.  I highly recommend at least seeing Avatar area at night, it is very beautiful.
				<br>
			</p><p>
				Places to Eat:
	           	<ul>
	           		<li>Sit Down: Rainforest Café, Yak and Yeti (DELICIOUS Chicken Marsala)</li>
	           		<li>Quick Service: Flame Tree Barbecue, Sabu’li Canteen</li>
	 			</ul>
				Ashley’s Favorite Drink: Rum Blossom-> this delightful beverage is located in Avatar area near the Canteen.
			</p>
			<img class="thingsToDo" src="Pics/ThingsToDo/Animal Kingdom Map.jpg" />
			<br>
			<div id="Epcot"></div>
			<br><br>
			<h3>Epcot</h3>
			<hr>
			<p>
				This is Ashley’s favorite park.  You can go from Mexico to Italy to Morocco to Canada all within hours, make sure to stop and enjoy each and every land!  Each one is a treasure trove of snacks, drinks, and trinkets.  The best pastries can be found in Norway (Kringla Bakeri Og Kafe) and France (Les Halles Boulangerie-Patisserie).  Wine (Ashley’s favorite) can be found in Italy (Tutto Gusto Wine Cellar), and of course for the beer drinkers Ashley has heard that the place for that is Germany (for the wine lover- there are Reislings!).  The World Showcase often opens a few hours after Future World so do not be discouraged by all the people at first, once the World Showcase opens people tend to spread out.
				<br><br>
				Fast Pass Options: Spaceship Earth, Mission SPACE (*Be warned: there are two options a Green and Orange.  Orange is an intense journey where you do experience G’s and what it would feel like in space- DO NOT RECOMMEND for those who have heart or blood pressure conditions- Don’t be a fool, Nicholas and Ashley want you at the wedding), Test Track, The Seas with Nemo and Friends, Soarin’ (Ashley’s mom’s favorite), Frozen Ever After (Located in Norway).
           		<br><br>
       		</p><p>
           		Note: The rides to pick and choose depend on your preference, the best lines would be Frozen Ever After.  You can sometimes catch Living with the Land at a dull time as well as Gran Fiesta Tour Starring the Three Caballeros (Mexico ride).  Most lands either have a ride or a show.
           		Places to Eat:
               	<br><br>
               	Sit Down: Nine Dragons Restaurant (China), Via Napoli Ristorante e Pizzeria (Ashley’s brother highly recommends), Teppan Edo (Japan), Le Cellier Steakhouse (Canada)
               	<br><br>
               	Quick Service: Electric Umbrella, Lotus Blossom Café (Ashley highly recommends the orange chicken and mango smoothie), Liberty Inn (America), Yorkshire County Fish Shop (Ashley’s Dad’s favorite)

				<p>"The Hedgehog and the Cactus" <br> - A pair of paintings by Ashley and Nicholas</p>
			</div>
			<p>
				Ashley is a soon-to-be vet, and Nicholas is a software developer. They met online with a dating app - "Coffee bagel bean" as Ashley loves to call it - neither of them really expecting anything from it. However, both of them ending up enjoying talking to the other and here they are, more than a year later and ready to get married. 
				<br>
				<br>
				Right from the start, Ashley and Nicholas have bonded over a shared love of animals. Well, almost from the start. The first date was a little rocky, until Nicholas accompanied Ashley to the Turtle Rescue Team Lab for an emergency. After meeting her patients, Nicholas ended up bonding with a special healing turtle named Trash Panda. 
				<div id="trashPanda">
					<img src="Pics/trash panda.jpg"/>
					<p>Trash Panda</p>
				</div>
				Since then, Nicholas has grown attached to Ashley's cats: Emi and Eevee. And adopted his own dog, Goose, who loves Ashley almost as much as Nicholas does.
				<br>
				<br>
				Nicholas proposed at Duke Gardens. The pair had waited until after 5 pm when they could bring Goose along for the walk. It was terribly hot, Ashley had just returned from Omaha for an externship, and she was focused on their dinner plans for a burger from Burger Bach (one of the couple's favorite spots). But Nicholas wanted to make a pit-stop - he chose a secluded bench in the Japanese gardens where he suggested they rest. While Ashley was looking away, trying to get Goose to drink water, Nicholas got down on one knee to surprise her. Unfortunately, Nicholas could not get the ring box out of his pocket, so Ashley caught on pretty quickly that he was up to something. After that characteristically rocky start, Nicholas asked Ashley to marry him. She, of course, asked if he talked to her dad - and then she said yes.
				<br>
				<br>
				The pair chose a Disney wedding because of how much Ashley loves Disney. Nicholas is enjoying seeing this place from her perspective while planning a Disney wedding. Ashley and Nicholas chose October 15<sup>th</sup> because they both wanted a fall wedding; however, this day is particularly special because it was Ashley's late grandfather's birthday. The wedding will have subtle tributes to Ashley and Nicholas' shared love of animals and of course a few hidden Mickeys!
				<br>
				<br>
				Ashley and Nicholas are very excited for you to witness their marrage and celebrate the next chapter of their lives together.
